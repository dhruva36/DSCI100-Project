# DSCI100 Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Introduction

As heart disease gradually becomes a leading global cause of death, it is critical to develop methods for early prediction in individuals at risk. Our project seeks to determine whether **age** and **maximum heart rate achieved** can predict the **diagnosis of heart disease**—specifically, the presence or absence of heart disease.

For this study, we used the **“processed.cleveland.data”** from the **Heart Disease Data Set** to build a classification model in R. This dataset contains 14 attributes that could potentially be used to diagnose heart disease. However, we focused on three key variables:

- _**age**_: Age of the individual
- _**thalach**_: Maximum heart rate achieved
- _**num**_: Diagnosis of heart disease (presence or absence)

Through this analysis, we aim to explore whether these factors are significant predictors of heart disease.
